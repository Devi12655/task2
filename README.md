ðŸš€ Task 2 Complete â€“ Building Interactive & Responsive Web Features!

As part of my Web Development Internship at ApexPlanet Software Pvt Ltd, I worked on enhancing web interactivity and responsiveness using:

âœ… HTML & CSS â€“ for creating structured forms and applying beautiful layouts using Flexbox and CSS Grid
âœ… JavaScript â€“ to add form validation and build a dynamic To-Do list with add/delete functionality
âœ… Responsive Design â€“ applied media queries to make layouts adapt to different screen sizes

This task challenged me to think more practically and improve the user experience. I'm learning how real-world web apps function, and it's been an exciting experience!
